        <tab heading="Julio-Claudian Dynasty (30BCE-69CE)">
          In the aftermath of the assassination of Julius Caesar, a civil war broke out that raged until Caesar's adopted son Octavian defeated all opposition by 30 BC and was left the sole owner of the Roman Republic. Over the 40 years of his reign, he reorganized to put the republic to place the senate in a subordinate position to his own power.<br>
          <br/>
          After his many reforms, his death in 14CE left his stepson Tiberius in charge, demonstrating finally the rule of the Roman Empire in a heriditary system. His rule was put in jeopardy by the rise in power of the Sejanus, a Praetorian Guard who seized considerable power in Rome by performing purges of his political rivals before being purged himself on the orders of Tiberius.<br>
          <br/>
          After Tiberius died in 37 CE, Caligula, a descendent of Augustus was left in joint rule alongside Gemellus, which lasted all of a year before Caligula either executed or forced Gemellus to kill himself. Caligula is charactized by many Roman authors as insane, and he is notable for political manouvers like appointing his horse a senator and cunning tactical planning like declaring war on the ocean and having his soldiers go down to the seashore and collecting seashells as victory spoils. By the year 41 he was assassinated himself but his own Praetorian Guard.<br>
          <br/>
          In the aftermath of Caligula's assassination, the Praetorian Guard stormed the royal palace and found Caligula's uncle Claudius hiding behind a curtain. Instead of killing him, they decided they needed someone to be an emperor to keep them in their position of status, and named him their emperor and everyone just went along with it. Claudius fought a lot of political instability and plots to overthrow him, but managed to invade Britain in his free time.<br>
          <br/>
          Claudius died in 54, leaving his adopted son Nero as the next emperor at the age of 16. Nero had a contentious reign due to such events as the city of Rome catching fire before marshmallows had even been invented. Ultimately his reign ended in the Senate growing resentful at their state of dimished power in the empire, which led to a coup that removed Nero from power, and he commited suicide in 68 to avoid capture.
        </tab>
        <tab heading="Flavian Dynasty (69CE-96CE)">
          After Nero's death, there was no clear descendent of Caesar in position to become emperor. The year 69 became known as the year of four emperors after the power stuggle that occured between multiple governors and generals across the empire in what was perhaps the highest casuality game show of the ancient world. In the end, a general named Vespasian took a holiday from conquering Jewish rebels to sieze Rome, and founded a new dynasty. He tore down Nero's golden palace and replaced it with the Roman Colosseum. Vespasian created a distinct style and impression to his rule, attempting to project the image of a common man of the people rather than an elite noble. He died in 79.<br>
          <br/>
          Vespasian's son Titus became emperor next in a short but exciting reign. About 3 or 4 months after he became emperor Mt. Vesuvius wiped out Pompeii, and the next year Rome caught on Fire again.  The year after that, in 81, Titus finished out the trilogy of heat related disasters by catching a fever and dying.<br>
          <br/>
          Titus' younger brother Domitian became emperor in 81 then, and was generally not looked upon super favorably by Roman historians. It seems he was pretty paranoid, which considering he got assassinated in 96 may have been a little justified.
        </tab>
        <tab heading="Antonine Dynasty (96CE-192CE)">
          The Antonine Dynasty is a historical classification that is a bit misleading: the Emperors from 96-192 were not a true dynasty as they were not generally from the same family. Instead emperors of this period (which were mostly childless) would adopt heirs (which was common practice at the time especially for noble families that had no children).
          The very same day as Domition's assassination in 96 the Senate declared one of their own, an old senator name Nerva emperor. Little is known about him before his ascention to power, and as he died 15 months later of a fever is mostly remembered for starting the tradition of adoption of heirs.<br>
          <br/>
          Nerva adopted Trajan (ruled 98–117), a general of the German legions, who became emperor in 98. During his reign the empire reach its greatest extent, with his invasion of Persia extending the Empire briefly through the fertile crescent down to the Persian gulf, as well as annexing northern Arabia and Dacia on the Western coast of the Black Sea. He also launched a wide array of building projects, mostly in an effort to stick his name on everything possible, ordering the creation of such works as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan%27s_Forum">Trajan's Forum</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan%27s_Market">Trajan's Market</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan%27s_Column">Trajan's Column</a> <br>
          <br/>
          Hadrian (ruled 117–138) would put a halt to Trajan's expanisionist policies and instead focus on consolidating power, except for his abandonment of the Mesopatamian provinces. He also did a lot of building, mostly famously Hadrian's wall (so called because it is a wall) to keep the northern border of England secure.  <br>
          <br/>
          Antoninus Pius (ruled 138–161) is interesting for holding the longest reign since Augustus of a Roman Emperor and also for undertaking no known major military campaigns during his rule, signifying a relatively stable period of the empire. He promoted building projects, legal reforms, education and artistic patronage, and economic prosperity.<br>
          <br/>
          Marcus Aurelius (ruled 161–180) began his reign as a co-emperor alongside <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Verus">Lucius Verus</a>. Marcus wanted to be a philosopher more than an emperor, but his reign began with a host of immediate problems: flooding in Rome, invasions from all along the germanic frontier, as well as a major war from the Parthian Empire to the east. While Marcus Aurelius stayed in Rome, Lucius became the emperor to command the armies, travelling east to fight the Parthians, in a tough conflict that became successful and Roman armies mached down the Euphrates river and captured the Parthian capital at Ctesephon. However upon reaching the city a plague broke out (suspected to be smallpox or measles) that forced a retreat to preserve supply lines. The returning troops brought the disease with them, causing the first of many epidemics to sweep across the empire. Lucius then went to fight the Germanic tribes but soon died of sickness leaving Marcus in sole command of the empire as of 169. Also of note during this time is the first direct Roman connections to China were established from Rome, as an attempt to maintain trade relations on the nascent silk road now that the routes were blocked by a hostile Parthia.<br>
          <br/>
          Commodus (177–192) was the first natural born son of an emperor since Titus to become emperor. Although his rule saw relatively less conflict with foriegn powers than his father's, internal conflict grew intensely with multiple assassination and coup attempts. This resulted (or perhaps was caused by) an increasing obessesion with promoting the cult of the emperor, with Commodus attempting to rename the months of the year and the city of Rome after himself; he also fought as a gladiator. In 192 an assassination attempt succeeded and Commodus was strangled in the bath.
        </tab>
        <tab heading="Severan Dynasty (193CE-235CE)">
          The death of Commodus led to conspiritorial control and ultimately a massive power struggle for rulership across the empire. 193 became known as the Year of Five Emperors, as several powerful individuals fought a civil war for control. The governor of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pannonia_Superior">Pannonia</a> at the time, Septimius Severus, would prove the ultimate victor and found a new dynasty. He reincoroporated northern Mesopotamia and attempted an invasion of Scotland. He also struggled a lot with controlling the Senate, as evidenced by the way he kept executing a ton of them. <br>
          <br/>
          Caracalla (ruled 211-217) was upon the death of his Father Septimius given the empire to rule jointly alongside his brother Geta. This lasted less than a year before Caracalla had his brother murdered, and he orchestrated a massive purge of all of his brother's supporters. He quickly gained a reputation for harsh rule, and was assassinated by a common soldier while on campaign.<br>
          <br/>
          Macrinus (217-218) deserves a special mention as not being from the Severan dynasty but being declared emperor after the death of Caracalla. He was the first emperor of the equestirian (not senatorial) class as well as of Moroccan descent. He was left with the unenviable task of figuring out how to handle the unsustainably high salaries for soldiers his predecessor had instated (in order to ensure control), and ultimately Macrinus would lose popularity and faced a rebellion, where he was captured and executed.<br>
          <br/>
          Elagabalus (218-222) was only around the age of 14 when he was made emperor, due to his claim as the grandson of Caracalla. His rule was short, and sources offer various accusations of immorality and impropriety, ranging from sexual scandals (he was married 5 times before his death at age 18, once to a vestal virgin) and his attempt to restructure the Roman Pantheon to place the sun as the center of worship. <br>
          <br/>
          Severus Alexander (222-235) was the cousin of Elagabalus and the grandson of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Maesa">Julia Maesa</a>, a powerful woman who was instrumental in buying off legions to support the rebellion that put Elagabalus in power. He would remain strongly influenced by her and his mother <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Avita_Mamaea">Julia Mamaea</a> for the duration of his reign. While the early part of his reign was prosperous, as time went on increasing pressure at the borders grew thanks to the rise of Sassanid takover of Persia, as well as increased pressure from incursions from the Germanic tribes to the north. In attempting to buy off these tribes instead of fighting them in open combat, Alexander lost support of the legions and he was assassinated in 235 in favor of a soldier named Maximius. By this time it was clear that the retirment package for being the roman emperor usually involved a knife in the back, and for nearly the next century imperial control would careen wildly between conflicting forces.

        <tab heading="Crisis of the 3rd Century (235CE-284CE)">
          During the 49 years between Septimus Alexander and Diocletian as emperor, 26 individuals claimed the title to emperor. An average of a new emperor every 22 months then was linked with near constant states of civil wars and rebellions, which made life difficult alongside the significant economic depression of the time period.
