                  In administering this empire, Sassanid rulers took the title of shahanshah (King of Kings), becoming the central overlords and also assumed guardianship of the sacred fire, the symbol of Zoroastrianism.Sassanid queens had the title of Banbishnan banbishn (Queen of Queens).<br>
                  In normal times, the monarchical office was hereditary, but might be transferred by the king to a younger son; in two instances the supreme power was held by queens. When no direct heir was available, the nobles and prelates chose a ruler, but their choice was restricted to members of the royal family.<br>
                  On a smaller scale, the territory might also be ruled by a number of petty rulers from a noble family, known as shahrdar, overseen directly by the shahanshah.

            <p>The districts of the provinces were ruled by a shahrab and a mowbed (chief priest). The mowbed's job was to deal with estates and other things relating to legal matters. Sasanian rule was characterized by considerable centralization, ambitious urban planning, agricultural development, and technological improvements.<br>
              Below the king, a powerful bureaucracy carried out much of the affairs of government; the head of the bureaucracy was the wuzurg framadar (vizier or prime minister).<br>
              The priestly class of Zoroastrianism, the state religion, were also inextriably linked with political life and often figured prominently as advisors and leaders.

On the whole though it had considerable similarities to the caste system of India, with four primary social classes:<br>
<br/>
  Asronan (priests) <br>
  Arteshtaran (warriors) <br>
  Wastaryoshan (commoners) <br>
  Hutukhshan (artisans) <br>
<br/>
At the center of the Sasanian caste system the shahanshah ruled over all the nobles. The royal princes, petty rulers, great landlords and priests, together constituted a privileged stratum, and were identified as wuzurgan, or grandees. This social system appears to have been fairly rigid, although rare exceptions could occur allowing an individual to change class depending on merit.
<br>
The Sassanid caste system would also carry a strong influence over into the early Islamic period. </p>

            <h2 class="h4 mb-4">Slavery</h2>
            <p>In general, mass slavery was never practiced by the Sassanids, but only as a system for houshold slaves or sometimes for debtors who had to use some of their time to serve in a fire-temple.<br>
            Certain protections existed: harming a slave was considered a crime, and not even the king himself was allowed to do it. The master of a slave was allowed to free the person when he wanted to, which, no matter what faith the slave believed in, was considered a good deed. A slave could also be freed if his/her master died.<br>
            Although in many ways this made being a slave almost preferable to living a life of a peasant, it came at the cost of personal autonomy. Although slaves could and did form families of their own, masters also were permitted to use female slaves to produce children.</p>

              During the early Sasanian period, Middle Persian along with Greek and Parthian appeared in the inscriptions of the early Sasanian kings. Quickly though Greek was phased out under the Sassanids, from both the efforts of the anti-Hellenic Zoroastrian clergy and also because Greek was commonplace among the Byzantines, the rivals of the Sassanids. Parthian soon disappeared as an administrative language too, but was continued to be spoken and written in the eastern part of the Sasanian Empire, the homeland of the Parthians.<br>
              Aramaic, like in the Achaemenid Empire, was widely used in the Sasanian Empire, and provided scripts for Middle Persian and other languages.

            <h2 class="h4 mb-8">Regional languages</h2>
            <p>
              Although Middle Persian was the native language of the Sasanians (who, however, were not originally from Pars), it was only a minority spoken-language in the vast Sasanian Empire. It became the administrative language of the empire, but it only formed the majority of Pars.
              <br>
              Besides Persian, Adhari along with one of its dialects, Tati, was spoken in Adurbadagan (Azerbaijan). Daylamite and Gilaki was spoken in Gilan, while Mazandarani (also known as Tabari) was spoken in Tabaristan.
              In Khuzestan, several languages were spoken; Persian in the north and east, while Aramaic was spoken in the rest of the place. In Meshan, the Arameans, along with settled Arabs (known as Mesenian Arabs), and the nomadic Arabs, formed the Semitic population of the province along with Nabataean and Palmyrene merchants. Among them were Indian groups such as the Malays may also have been deported to Meshan, either as captives or recruited sailors. In Asoristan the majority of the people were Aramaic-speaking Nestorian Christians while the Persians, Jews and Arabs formed a minority in the province.
              <br>
              In the Caucasus, numerous languages were sproken including Georgian, various Kartvelian languages (notably in Lazica), Armenian, Caucasian Albanian, Scythian, Greek, and others were common.
              Due to invasions from the Scythians and their sub-group, the Alans, into Azerbaijan, Armenia, and other places in the Caucasus, the places gained a larger, although small, Iranian population. Parthian, along with other Iranian dialects and languages was spoken in Khorasan, while to the further east in places which were not always controlled by the Sasanians, Sogdian, Bactrian and Khwarazmian was spoken. To the further south in Sistan, which saw an influx of Scythians during the Parthian period, Sistani was spoken. Kirman was populated by an Iranian group which closely resembled the Persians, while, farther to the east in Paratan, Turan and Makran, Balochi and non-Iranian languages were spoken.
              <br>
              In major cities such as Gundeshapur and Ctesiphon, Latin, Greek and Syriac were spoken by Roman/Byzantine prisoners of war. Furthermore, Slavic and Germanic were also spoken in the Sasanian Empire, once again due to the capture of Roman soldiers. Semitic languages including Himyaritic and Sabaean were spoken in Yemen.

              Although in many ways was built on Achaemenid traditions, the art of the Sassanids brought a wide array of influences together, including as far as China and the Mediterranean.
              <br>
              The surviving art of the Sassanids is best seen in its architecture, stone reliefs and metalwork, and there are some surviving paintings from what was evidently a widespread production. Numerous artifacts such as pottery and coins offer insight into styles of the time as well.
              <br>
              Although Parthian art preferred the front view, the narrative representations of the Sassanian art often features figures shown in the profile or a three-quarter view. Frontal views occur less frequently.
